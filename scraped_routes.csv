The Goon Of Fortune,Sport,20,"15m, 10","The line of tight squeeze directly up from Hotdog Power. A nice bit of continuous intensity climbing up the flake until a no hands rest spoils it all. Top is easier than it first appears. Start at Hotdog Power and continue straight up the line of bolts. For a much better start do the easier less knee destroying Hotdog Water start and traverse in for the same grade.

Chiffre Apres Chiffre,Sport,22,"15m, 9","Fifth line of bolts right from the arete of Hotdog Water. Thin wall climbing with a number of cruxy sequences. For the feel of the first ascent and a struggle at the grade climb the last two bolts on their left side rather than the pikers variant which uses the holds unearthed for the climb Womb Raider.

The Need For Squeeze,Sport,20,"15m, 6","Start as for Shutdown Funk but follow the left line of bolts. Then up the left side of the arete above. Can be used as an alternate start to Shutdown Funk to eliminate the need to carry a rack of wigglies. If you are finding it hard for the grade then either; (1) Get stronger or (2) Grow taller.
